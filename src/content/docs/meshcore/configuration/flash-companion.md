## Flashing a Companion Node

:::caution[USB Serial Drivers]
You may need to install drivers on your computer to connect to your device.
:::

The easiest way to flash a MeshCore-supported node is by using the official web flasher tool in **Google Chrome**:

**[MeshCore Web Flasher](https://meshcore.io/flasher)**  
Only some Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) support the [serial connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API#browser_compatibility) required for flashing.

### Steps

1. Plug your device into your computer via USB.
2. Open the **MeshCore Web Flasher**.
3. Select your device hardware.
4. Select the firmware type: **Companion Radio (Bluetooth)**.
5. Click **Enter DFU Mode**.
6. Click **Erase Flash**.
7. Click **Flash** to install the MeshCore firmware.

:::note
If the flash step fails after erasing, refresh the page, click **Enter DFU Mode** again, then click **Flash** to retry.

## Configuring a Companion Node

After flashing, follow these steps to complete setup:

1. Pair the node with your phone or computer (usually over Bluetooth).
2. Give the node a descriptive **name** (for example: your callsign, location, or handle).
3. Set the Ottawa frequency defaults:  
   **910.525 MHz / BW: 62.5 kHz / SF7 / CR5**
4. Test the node by sending a message in the **Public channel**.
   - If a repeater hears you, the message will show **Heard X Repeats** instead of just **Sent**.

:::tip
You may want to disable **Message Settings → Auto Reset Path**.  
This isn’t required, but many users find it useful when testing unstable links because it prevents the path from constantly resetting.
