:::caution[No warranty]
This is to help the community understand how to make a repeater, and I by no means provide any warranty for anyone following this guide. Please test everything first with a multimeter and other tools before powering anything on.
:::

**Board:** GOME Ikoka Stick (HW v0.4.0)  
**Power:** Waveshare Solar Power Manager (standard)  
**Firmware:** MeshCore

This guide walks through assembling a solar-powered MeshCore repeater using the GOME Ikoka Stick, a junction box enclosure, and an epoxied solar panel. Follow each step carefully for a reliable and weatherproof build.

:::note[When to use a 1W repeater]
1W repeaters should typically be used for backbone links and for locations that are struggling to connect to the mesh. They are not necessary for every deployment.
:::

:::danger[Antenna Required]
Always ensure a LoRa antenna is attached to the Ikoka Stick before powering it on. Transmitting without an antenna can permanently damage the radio module.

### Antenna

An antenna is not included in this parts list as selection will vary by deployment. It is highly recommended to use a higher dBi antenna such as a 6-8 dBi or higher with 1W builds. We have found that the Ikoka Stick does not pair well with the Alfa 5.8 dBi antenna for some reason, with several folks in Ottawa observing noticeably worse signal quality when using them together. This is not a definitive statement, just a pattern observed across multiple deployments.

For recommended antenna options, see the [GOME Repeater Omni Antennas](../../recommended-antenna#repeater-omni-antennas) page.

## Assembly Steps

### Enclosure Preparation

1. Flip the solar panel face-down. On the back, locate the black junction box where the red and black power wires exit. Measure this junction box with calipers or a ruler.

2. On the **front face** of the gray junction box, use a pencil to trace a rectangle matching the solar panel junction box dimensions. Center it near the top of the panel.

3. Using a step drill bit, drill a large starter hole in the center of the traced rectangle.

4. Using a jigsaw or rotary tool, cut along the traced lines to remove the rectangular section. Clean up any rough edges.

### Mounting the Solar Panel

5. Mix a batch of Gorilla Epoxy and apply it generously across the entire front face of the junction box, covering the area where the solar panel will sit.

6. Route the solar panel's power cable through the rectangular cutout from the outside into the box.

   ![Solar panel wires routed through junction box](../../../../assets/hardware/repeater-nodes/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build-1.jpg)

7. Press the solar panel onto the epoxied face of the junction box. Place a flat piece of wood across the front of the panel and use clamps on all four corners to apply even pressure. Be careful not to over-tighten, as this can crack the panel. Alternatively, lay the assembly flat on the ground with weights on the back of the box.

8. Allow the epoxy to fully cure according to the manufacturer's instructions before removing the clamps.

9. Using clear outdoor silicone caulk, apply a bead around all four edges where the solar panel meets the junction box. Smooth the caulk to create a weatherproof seal.

### Mounting Plate and Filter

10. Attach the four M3x35 spacers to the corners of the junction box mounting plate. You may need to use a 1/8" drill bit to open the holes slightly to fit M3 screws through the plate. Use the 3D-printed mount plate as a reference for hole placement.

    ![Mounting plate with spacers and filter assembled](../../../../assets/hardware/repeater-nodes/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build-2.jpg)

11. Mount the RF bandpass filter to the mounting plate, positioning it roughly in the center.

12. Connect the N-Type to SMA cable to the filter's **output** port. This cable will pass through the box wall to the external antenna.

13. Determine where the N-Type connector should exit the junction box. Using a step drill bit, drill the hole, stepping up one size at a time and test-fitting after each step until the connector fits snugly.

14. Feed the N-Type connector through the box wall from the inside out and tighten the O-ring nut to secure it.

15. On the **bottom** of the junction box, drill a hole for the waterproof vent plug using the step drill bit.

16. Install the vent plug and tighten it.

### Filter and Radio Preparation

17. Connect the SMA-to-SMA cable to the filter's **input** port. Finger-tighten for now.

18. **Waveshare Solar Power Manager prep (standard model):** On the back of the board, solder a wire across the boot button pads to short it permanently. Without this modification, the board will not automatically resume power output after a power loss, meaning your repeater would stay offline until you physically press the button.

    ![Boot button shorted on Waveshare Solar Power Manager](../../../../assets/hardware/repeater-nodes/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build-4.jpg)

### Component Mounting

19. Outside the box (for easier access), mount the Ikoka Stick and the Waveshare Solar Power Manager to the 3D-printed mounting plate. If using the optional INA3221, mount it as well.

20. **(Optional, Adafruit INA3221)** Using a soldering iron, carefully remove the Ikoka Stick's OLED display header pins. Work slowly and gently to avoid damaging nearby components.

21. **(Optional, Adafruit INA3221)** Solder the INA3221 to the Ikoka's I2C bus using the display header pads. See the [INA3221 Wiring](#ina3221-wiring-optional) section below for the pin connections.

    ![INA3221 wired to Ikoka Stick I2C with Waveshare Solar Power Manager](../../../../assets/hardware/repeater-nodes/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build/repeater-solar-1w-diy-build-5.jpg)

22. Install the mounting plate assembly into the junction box and secure it with M3x5 screws into the M3x35 spacers.

### Battery Installation

23. Attach the 3D-printed battery holder to the inside front of the case, below where the solar panel wires enter. Use double-sided tape or epoxy to secure it.

24. If your 18650 battery pack does not have a built-in PCM (protection circuit module), wire the battery protection board between the battery and the Waveshare. Follow the polarity markings carefully.

### Power Wiring

25. **(Optional, Adafruit INA3221) Solar wiring:** Connect the solar panel positive wire to INA3221 **CH3+**. Connect CH3- to the Waveshare solar input positive. Connect the solar panel negative wire directly to the Waveshare solar input negative.

26. **(Optional, Adafruit INA3221) Battery wiring:** Connect the battery (or the PCM) positive wire to INA3221 **CH1+**. Connect CH1- to the positive pin on the Waveshare battery JST PH2.0 connector. Connect the battery negative wire directly to the negative pin on the JST PH2.0 connector. Plug the connector into the Waveshare board.

:::note
If you are not using the INA3221, wire the solar panel and battery directly to the Waveshare board's solar and battery inputs.
:::

### Final Connections

27. Connect the SMA cable from the filter's input to the Ikoka Stick's SMA connector. Tighten both ends firmly with a wrench or pliers. A loose RF connection will cause signal loss.

28. Run the USB-A to USB-C cable from the Waveshare Solar Power Manager's USB output to the Ikoka Stick's USB-C input.

    _If using the Adafruit INA3221, your completed assembly should look similar to this:_

## INA3221 Wiring (Optional)

The Adafruit INA3221 connects to the Ikoka Stick via I2C using the **OLED display header** pads. Remove the display header pins and solder wires directly to the pads.

**I2C connection (Ikoka display header to INA3221):**

| Ikoka Display Header | INA3221 Pin | Wire   |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Pin 1 - GND          | GND         | Ground |
| Pin 2 - VCC (3.3V)   | VCC         | Power  |
| Pin 3 - SCL          | SCL         | Clock  |
| Pin 4 - SDA          | SDA         | Data   |

**INA3221 channel assignments:**

| Channel | Connected To | Purpose                                          |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| CH1     | Battery      | Monitor battery voltage and current draw         |
| CH2     | (unused)     | Available for future use                         |
| CH3     | Solar        | Monitor solar input voltage and charging current |

:::note
VCC on the INA3221 is the board power pin (3.3V from the Ikoka). VIN1/VIN2/VIN3 are the measurement channel inputs, not the power pin.
:::

**Firmware build flags:** MeshCore does not auto-detect the Adafruit INA3221 at its default address. Add these flags to your build configuration:

```ini
[env:ikoka_stick_nrf_30dbm_repeater]
build_flags =
  ${ikoka_stick_nrf_repeater.build_flags}
  ${ikoka_stick_nrf_e22_30dbm.build_flags}
  -D TELEM_INA3221_ADDRESS=0x40
  -UENV_INCLUDE_INA219
```

The Adafruit INA3221 sits at I2C address `0x40`, but MeshCore expects `0x42`. The `-D TELEM_INA3221_ADDRESS=0x40` flag corrects this. The `-UENV_INCLUDE_INA219` flag disables INA219 support to prevent conflicts.
