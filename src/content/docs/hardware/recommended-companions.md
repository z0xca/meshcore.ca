Companion nodes run dedicated companion firmware and operate as user endpoints on the MeshCore/Meshtastic network.  
Most companion nodes pair with your smartphone over BLE to provide access to the mesh.

There are also standalone companion nodes with built-in screens and input devices. These operate without a smartphone but still function as endpoints.

:::catuion[Upgrade the companion antenna]
The included antenna performs poorly on all of these models. Plan to replace it, and upgrade to at least the Gizont on companions that support changing the antenna.

## Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Companions

These devices require a smartphone and the MeshCore or Meshtastic app. They connect to your phone over BLE, and you use the app to interact with the mesh. In this setup, the companion acts only as the radio, linking your phone to the mesh network.

### Pre-Built

The easiest way to get started is to buy a companion node, flash it with MeshCore/Meshtastic, and join the mesh.

The MeshCore/Meshtastic app connects to the node over Bluetooth (BLE) and is used to send and receive messages on the mesh.

:::caution[Important ThinkNode M1 Note]
Make sure to order an **RP-SMA Antenna** with the device.  
 **Do not accidentally buy SMA — you specifically need RP-SMA.**  
 ThinkNode uses RP-SMA for the ThinkNode M1 for some reason

The following pre-built companion nodes are popular and widely available:

### Build Your Own

For hobbyists who like to source parts and assemble their own node, here is an Ottawa-friendly example build (antenna not included; see [Recommended Antennas](../recommended-antenna)).

This is a **companion node** role and requires a smartphone.  
The MeshCore/Meshtastic app connects to the node over Bluetooth (BLE) and is used to send and receive messages on the mesh.

:::caution[Case for Example DIY Build]
This DIY build example does not include a case. For 3D-printable cases, check out **[Alley Cat’s models](https://www.printables.com/@AlleyCat/models)** — they are excellent for custom companion node builds. Make sure the case you choose will fit the 3000 mAh battery and the right angle IPEX to SMA connector.

## Standalone Nodes

There are standalone devices such as the **T-Deck**, but we recommend starting with a companion node instead.  
Standalone units tend to be more expensive, the UI is not as smooth as the mobile app, and they still have quirks and firmware limitations that can make them challenging for beginners.

### Available Standalone Devices

| **LilyGO T-Deck Plus**  | Updated version of the T-Deck with improved specs and refinements. Built with Meshtastic/MeshCore/Meshtastic in mind.<br>**However:** the built-in trackball is a major downside and many users dislike it. | [LilyGO Store](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-deck-plus-meshtastic) |
