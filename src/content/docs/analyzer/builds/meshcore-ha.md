title: MeshCore-HA (Home Assistant)
---

Add the MeshCore.ca broker pair to your Home Assistant MeshCore integration. This connects your HA instance to the Canadian mesh telemetry network.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement    | Details                                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home Assistant | With the MeshCore integration installed                                                |
| MeshCore Node  | Connected to HA via USB, BLE, or TCP                                                   |
| IATA Code      | The same real 3-letter IATA airport code used by your observer (e.g. `YOW` for Ottawa) |
| Mesh Settings  | Connected node uses `USA/Canada (Recommended)` and 3-byte path hashes                  |

## Setup

:::tip[Known-good setup]
A Home Assistant observer needs three things to line up: both brokers connected, **Payload Mode** set to `packet` (or **Packets (Lets Mesh)** enabled on older screens), and the same real IATA code on both broker entries.
:::

    The connected MeshCore node must also be on the MeshCore Canada network settings: **USA/Canada (Recommended)**, or raw radio values `910.525 MHz / 62.5 kHz / SF7 / CR5`, with 3-byte path hashes.

### 1. Open Broker Settings

Navigate to:

**Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **MeshCore** > **Configure** > **Manage MQTT Brokers**

### 2. Configure the Primary Broker

| Field                   | Value                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Server                  | `mqtt1.meshcore.ca`                    |
| Port                    | `443`                                  |
| Transport               | `websockets`                           |
| Use TLS                 | Enabled                                |
| TLS Verify              | Enabled                                |
| Username / Password     | Leave blank                            |
| Use MeshCore Auth Token | Enabled                                |
| Token Audience          | `mqtt1.meshcore.ca`                    |
| Auth Token TTL          | Leave default                          |
| Payload Mode            | `packet`                               |
| Status Topic            | `meshcore/{IATA}/{PUBLIC_KEY}/status`  |
| Packets Topic           | `meshcore/{IATA}/{PUBLIC_KEY}/packets` |
| Client ID Prefix        | Optional                               |
| Owner Public Key        | Optional (TLS verified only)           |
| Owner Email             | Optional (TLS verified only)           |

### 3. Configure the Backup Broker

Add a second broker with the same settings, changing only:

| Field          | Value               |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Server         | `mqtt2.meshcore.ca` |
| Token Audience | `mqtt2.meshcore.ca` |

All other fields remain the same as the primary broker.

:::caution[Packet mode is required]
If your Home Assistant version shows a checkbox or option named **Packets (Lets Mesh)**, enable it. In newer versions this is the **Payload Mode** setting and it must be `packet`. If this is missed, the broker can appear connected while no packet data shows up.
:::

### 4. Set Your Region

Make sure your IATA code is set in the integration. The `{IATA}` placeholder in the topic templates will be replaced with your code (e.g. `YOW`).

The Home Assistant integration must use the same IATA code as the observer that is publishing packets. If Home Assistant is set to `YOW` but the observer publishes under `YKF`, Home Assistant will subscribe to the wrong topics and look empty.

Current MeshCore-HA versions use a free-text **Broker IATA Code** field, so you can type a real code such as `YTR` even if it is missing from a quick list. If your Home Assistant screen only offers a picker and does not let you enter the code manually, update the MeshCore integration before using a neighboring airport code as a workaround.

:::tip
You can find common Canadian IATA codes on the [IATA Region Codes](../../iata-codes) page. If your nearest real airport code is missing from that quick list, you can still use it.

## Common HA Symptoms

| Symptom                                      | Most likely fix                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brokers show connected but no packets appear | Enable **Packets (Lets Mesh)** or set **Payload Mode** to `packet`  |
| `YTR` or another code is not selectable      | Update MeshCore-HA, then type the code in **Broker IATA Code**      |
| One broker works and the backup does not     | Check the second broker's **Token Audience** is `mqtt2.meshcore.ca` |
| Packets appear under the wrong city          | Set both broker IATA fields to the nearest real airport code        |

## Verify

After saving, head to [Check Your Observer](../../verify) to confirm it's reporting correctly.
